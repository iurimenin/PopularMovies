# PopularMovies

First project made for Udacity Android Nanodegree

This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it to:
    ```
    app/build.gradle
    ```
